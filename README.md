# Livepeer Wiki

## Getting Started

If you are interested in developing video applications, running an orchestrator node or staking/delegating check out the [documentation](https://docs.livepeer.org/).

If you are interested in a community curated list of Livepeer applications and tools check out the [awesome-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/awesome-livepeer) page.

## Learn More

If you want to learn more about the current state of the protocol and network, then we recommend doing the following:

1. Review the [whitepaper](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md) for the original proposal behind the protocol and network.
2. Review the proposals that have updated the protocol since genesis and for historical context behind design decisions.
	- The protocol is updated via [Livepeer Improvement Proposals (LIPs)](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs).
	- An exception is the [Streamflow proposal](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/STREAMFLOW.md) which was introduced prior to formalization of the LIP process within the community. 
3. Review the smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain and the Arbitrum One rollup.
	- [Core protocol contracts](https://github.com/livepeer/protocol)
	- [Arbitrum bridge contracts](https://github.com/livepeer/arbitrum-lpt-bridge)
4. Review [go-livepeer](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/tree/master), a Go implementation of a Livepeer node.
5. Review the specifications to understand low level details.
	- [Core protocol spec](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/spec/streamflow/spec.md)
	- [Probabilistic micropayments spec](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/spec/streamflow/pm.md)
